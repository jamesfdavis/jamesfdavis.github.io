I wanted to work through a change in obtaining customer feedback during the floral delivery process.

As a software engineer, some of the best results come from the consistent and reliable feedback loop from software build processes. With a reasonable amount of quality feedback, the ability to ideate, in real-time, helps produce a better product.

## Floral order state

{: .pt-4 .px-1 .pb-2}
The floral firm ordering process is straight forward but lacks the real-time feedback a customer may find helpful. When an order is received, the customer typically will not see delivery of the final project. I have laid out both the current and photo feedback in a state diagram.

The standard process is to receive an order, make the arrangement, and deliver it to the customer. However, if we adjust the process a bit with a photo before delivery. The customer would be informed about the nature of the final arrangement. Customers would have the opportunity to give feedback or appreciation before delivery.

Incorporating customer feedback into the process may seem like a subtle change that generates more upfront work. However, it increases customer engagement and satisfaction with the firm.

#### Closing thoughts

{: .pt-4 .px-1}
Floral arrangements are not a typical product category. May customers submit an order and never see the result. The promise that the arrangement comes close to the picture online. But between constraints on flower availability or the florist's interpretation, the customer may get something quite different than they expect. Adding a photo as part of the feedback loop should be helpful to level-set expectations.
